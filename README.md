# Frontend Frameworks

Recently I watched the following two videos:

- [Ranking The Most Popular Javascript Frameworks 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRT5UAuDvYQ)
- [JavaScript Framework Tier List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJRf7dh5Zws)

And that's why I decided to implement a small frontend application with each of the following frameworks to get a first impression of them:

- [ ] [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [ ] [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
- [ ] [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- [ ] [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
- [ ] [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
- [ ] [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [ ] [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [ ] [Qwik](https://www.qwik.dev/)
- [ ] [React](https://react.dev/)
- [ ] [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [ ] [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- [ ] [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) (SolidStart)
- [ ] [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (SvelteKit)
- [ ] [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

Not considered:

- [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Ember](https://emberjs.com/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)
- [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)

Scope:

> TODO

Brief side notes:

- This won't be a ranking.
- I have some experience with Angular and React.
- I don't make a big distinction between framework, library, meta framework, etc.
- It's not about implementing production-ready applications - actually it will be far from that.
